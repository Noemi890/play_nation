# play_nation

## A simple serverless application, made with mock data using a Json file, to improve my skills using React, ReactModal, ReactDom, Javascript, CSS and Tailwind.

### A Website that allows the User, through a list of games, to choose the game he is interested in and have more information about it, with the possibility to be redirected to the actual website to have even more informations.

[Live Application](https://playnation.netlify.app/)

### This is a short video that focus on the main key features:

- Used **_TailWind animation_** to animate the elements through the app.
- Created my own Card Component using **_React and CSS_**.
- Used **_ReactModal_** to display a Dialog for categories.
- Used **_React Hooks_** to navigate/manage the Data through the app.
